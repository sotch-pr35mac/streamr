streamr
=======

An easy and effective way to get reading done fast with [Spritz reading technology](http://www.spritzinc.com/) and [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)

Built by students for students using these great open open source projects:
-[Miserlou's OpenSpritz](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz)
-[antimatter15's OCRAD.js](https://github.com/antimatter15/ocrad.js)

Disclaimer
==========

Right now streamr is in rough stages of development and might not work up to expectations (especially the OCR). It was built in an hour as a quick study tool.

Goal
====

The goal for streamr is to have a web app and Android app that allow for pdf files, images of text (pictures from textbooks) and plain text to be able to be read through Spritz.
